Have you ever felt the tension between getting more done and actually being present for the things that matter? In a recent episode of [_Mac Power Users_](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/784), Michael Hyatt shared insights on how AI is reshaping productivity. His reflections got me thinking--not just about the tools we use, but about the deeper question of how we steward our time in ministry.

## AI as a Tool, Not a Master

Hyatt talked about his use of custom AI assistants to streamline tasks--writing, scheduling, brainstorming. It's fascinating to consider how AI can take care of the administrative load, freeing us to focus on what only we can do. Imagine an AI drafting sermon outlines or summarizing meeting notes, allowing more time for face-to-face discipleship and prayer.

But here's the caution: AI is a tool, not a master. Hyatt warned of the risk of over-reliance--of using AI to such a degree that we lose the personal, relational essence of our work. That struck a chord. In ministry, efficiency isn't the goal--faithfulness is. AI might write an email faster, but it can't sit beside a grieving widow, or listen to the quiet pain behind someone's words.

## The Tension of Productivity and Presence

This brings us to a crucial question: How do we discern what should be automated and what requires our personal investment? Technology is a gift, but like all gifts, it must be stewarded wisely. Paul reminds us in Ephesians 5:15-16, 

> "Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity."

The point isn't just to be productive but to be purposeful.

So, how do we hold this balance? A few questions I'm asking myself:

- **Is this task something only I can do?** If not, maybe it's okay to delegate (to a person or an AI).
- **Is this making me more present or more distracted?** Technology should serve relationships, not replace them.
- **Am I trusting in God's leading or in my own efficiency?** There's a difference between working wisely and trying to do it all.

I'm looking forward to exploring these questions with a group of pastors at a colloquium in March. Conversations like these--about how we navigate technology, ministry, and the call to be faithfully present--are essential as we discern the best way forward. It's not just about using new tools but about shaping a rhythm of life that reflects God's wisdom and grace.
