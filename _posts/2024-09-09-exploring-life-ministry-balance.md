After a few years of settling into my role as pastor of The United Church in Canandaigua, New York, I am excited to relaunch this blog. It has been a period of adjustment and growth, and now I am eager to reconnect with you all through these reflections and discussions.

Last year, I had the privilege of joining a colloquium that brings together 25 pastors from a variety of backgrounds and geographical settings. This diverse group of ministers faces similar challenges in ministry, and our shared experiences have been both enlightening and encouraging. It’s remarkable how our struggles and triumphs in ministry, though unique in context, often resonate deeply across different settings.

This year, I will be leading a discussion on life-ministry balance. It’s a topic that is both timely and crucial, given the demands and pressures that come with pastoral work. My aim is to use this blog as a space to explore and develop ideas on maintaining a healthy balance between our personal lives and our ministerial responsibilities.

I look forward to sharing insights and engaging in thoughtful dialogue about how we can all better navigate this delicate balance. Stay tuned for more posts, and as always, I welcome your thoughts and contributions to this ongoing conversation.
