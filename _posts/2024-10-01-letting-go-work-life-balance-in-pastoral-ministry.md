In our staff devotional time this morning, we surveyed Psalm 46. This is a wonderful reflection on God's presence and provision during tumultuous times. The psalm begins with a confession of God's strength and help in times of trouble. It goes on to describe dramatic destruction, such as *the earth giving way*, *mountains falling into the heart of the sea*, and *waters roaring*. I cannot help but consider the effects of Hurricane Helene in recent days. The images of buildings being swept away and the massive destruction of roads are in my mind. Where is God in the middle of such difficulties? Psalm 46 is a wonderful message in the midst of these realities.

The psalms were often sung in ancient times, and verses 7 and 11 might qualify as a chorus. The verses are identical.

> Psalm 46:7 (and 11) (NIV): The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

God is with us. He has not left us in seasons of difficulty. Verses 8-9 describe God as the destroyer of war. He *makes wars cease*, *breaks the bow*, *shatters the spear*, and *burns the shields*. Again, the images of war in our world today come to mind. Death and destruction abound. Yet this psalm reminds us that God is with us and is our fortress.

When we come to verse 10, we find a familiar phrase.

> Psalm 46:10 (NIV): Be still, and know that I am God

We often see this passage alongside tranquil images of snow-covered forests or peaceful lakes. We think of relaxing and enjoying the beauty of God's creation. But there is more to this phrase than simply finding a peaceful moment. It is about our posture when it seems like the world is crumbling.

As I think about work-life balance, this psalm reminds us that we are not in control. While we often attempt to work harder, strive a bit more, and put in a few more hours, we must remind ourselves that the work is not ours. Our ministry is God's work. Our ministry is less about solving problems and more about relying on God.

Psalm 46 is a passage worth reading over and over. As pastors, we often find ourselves in the middle of tragedy or turmoil. We are with people when their lives are taking undesirable turns. We may attempt to fix the problem or see ourselves as the heroes bringing comfort. May we learn to *be still* during these times and allow God to do what He wills. May we simply stop and point to God, who is in charge. Let's release control, responsibility, and pride. Let's *be still* and *know that God is God*.
