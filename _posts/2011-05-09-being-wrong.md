title: Being Wrong
---

I watched a very interesting TED talk today. "Wrongologist" Kathryn Schulz describes the necessity of admitting our fallibility. While some dismiss her talk as an argument for tolerance, I find her points extremely applicable to the church. Don't get me wrong, I am not proposing that compromise Jesus exclusive claim as "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6) But, I think we do need to consider our own ability to err.

Christians are often arrogant, maybe because we have a direct line to God. We feel that because we are God's children we are more informed than everyone else. Be it politics, theology, or church methodology, we have the correct answers. Kathryn Schulz challenges our need to be right all the time. She proposes that we will ultimately find freedom as we give ourselves permission to be wrong. 

Even when we are confident in our opinions, our attitudes should reflect the possibility that we are wrong. This mindset is consistent with Jesus' teaching in Matthew 5. He describes the meek, the poor in spirit, and the peacemakers as "blessed". We often forget this posture. 

As we discern the movement of God in our midst, we may miss the mark. We may not get it all right. An adequate appreciation for our errors will go a long way. Remaining humble, teachable, and open to new directions are essential characteristics for each of us. Take a few minutes to watch and let me know what you think.
