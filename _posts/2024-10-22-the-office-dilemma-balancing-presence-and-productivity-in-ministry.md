We are rethinking our workspaces on our church property, potentially repurposing a staff office to expand our welcome area. The planning discussions have been intriguing, revealing how little time we actually spend in the office. This doesn't mean we seldom work; rather, our work often occurs offsite. We frequently meet for lunches and walks to connect with people, and even our "office" work often takes place in coffee shops and quiet spaces away from the church.

When I reflect on my workflow, I realize I do my best work away from the church. Creative work at my office desk is nearly impossible due to constant interruptions and difficulty focusing. However, a short walk to a coffee shop significantly enhances my productivity.

As church leaders, how do we address this? It's crucial to be present for hallway conversations with staff and church members, and to be available for quick interactions. Yet, when do these encounters hinder our best work? How do we balance time in the office with time in more productive environments?

I am looking forward to deeper conversations about these dynamics at our spring colloquium. Different patterns might be necessary based on personality types, learning styles, church environments, and congregational expectations. Nonetheless, I find it essential to leave the office to do my best work. I encourage pastors pursuing work-life balance to consider this dynamic. Too often, a lack of intentionality in this area can stall our progress. May we feel both the freedom and the responsibility to evaluate our environments so that we can focus on the work God has called us to do.
