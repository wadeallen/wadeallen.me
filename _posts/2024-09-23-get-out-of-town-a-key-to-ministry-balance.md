As I consider work-life balance and sustainable ministry, it seems that a crucial aspect is getting out of town. Not long after moving to Upstate New York, my wife and I discovered [Silver Bay YMCA Pastoral Respite Center](https://silverbay.org/respite/). The center provides respite and other programs for ministry workers. This benefit is not reserved for full-time ministers alone but is open to anyone who works in a church or ministry. As of this writing, participants can come to Silver Bay for up to 14 nights per year.

To say that Silver Bay is beautiful is an understatement. Nestled on the shores of Lake George and surrounded by mountains, it is truly a breathtaking place. The lodging and meals are high quality and provide an extremely comfortable setting.

As I think about maintaining work-life balance in ministry, taking time to escape to places like Silver Bay is a key component. Given that there is no cost for lodging and meals, an airline ticket and car rental would be a small price to pay for the benefits provided by Silver Bay. At the same time, you may find similar places that are closer to your ministry context.

Either way, I strongly advocate *getting out of town* at least a couple of times a year for rest and recharging. Silver Bay has become this place for us. So, get out your calendar and begin to set time aside to *get out of town*. If you are not intentional in planning these trips, it will likely not happen.
