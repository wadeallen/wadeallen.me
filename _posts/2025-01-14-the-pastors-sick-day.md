A few weeks ago, I got sick - on a Saturday afternoon, of all times. For a pastor, this is perhaps the most challenging time to fall ill. Thankfully, we are a multi-staffed church. I called our associate pastor, emailed my sermon, and witnessed God's provision unfold. He did a phenomenal job, and by afternoon my phone was filled with texts offering prayers for healing and appreciation for his ministry.

For many pastors, handing off a sermon just hours before worship simply isn't an option. This experience caused me to reflect deeply on my role and function at the church. Being temporarily incapacitated raised important questions about what I should and shouldn't be doing. And yes, it made me consider the classic "what if I get hit by a bus?" scenario.

This question strikes at the heart of ministry sustainability and work-life balance. Even as a solo pastor in a small church, we should strive to be surrounded by capable people who can step into any aspect of our work. Imagine creating a spreadsheet of everything we do - there should be very few blank spaces in the "backup" column for each task.

I confess there were seasons when I over-functioned in ministry. My hands were in everything - from printing bulletins to setting up the church WiFi. I updated the website, led most meetings, and was the last one to lock up the building. For some pastors, these tasks are simply expected. But maintaining a healthy work-life balance becomes nearly impossible under such circumstances.

I don't pretend to have all the answers for shifting away from this dynamic. In my case, it required changing ministry contexts. When I began my new pastorate, I intentionally avoided falling into the pattern of doing everything. If you're reading this and identifying with this description, I challenge you to consider how you might begin shifting this reality in your context.

Hopefully, none of us will get hit by a bus. But my prayer for you - for every pastor - is that you would find fulfillment in all aspects of life, not just church work. Let's be intentional about planning for our absence. When we do, the church will be stronger, healthier, and more aligned with God's vision for His body.
