As the new year begins, I take a moment to reflect on the books I've read last year and identify those I'd like to explore this year. One notable recommendation for 2024 is Morgan Housel's book *Same as Ever: A Guide to What Never Changes*, which I highly suggest for church leaders. The key theme of the book emphasizes that timeless truths can guide us through cultural shifts. In a rapidly changing world, it's valuable to remember the constant aspects of human behavior, such as fear, greed, and adaptability. While our culture evolves, it is refreshing to contemplate what remains unchanged.

In chapter 8, Housel highlights the significance of stories and narratives, a topic that resonates with preaching and leadership. He explains how compelling stories draw people in and can profoundly influence our thinking. Considering the Bible as a narrative reinforces the idea that such stories shape our community. I am reminded of the crucial role storytelling plays in preaching, which, while not new, is an important aspect that endures.

Our church family is currently engaged in a discernment process regarding the use of a significant financial gift to our church. Opinions on how to use or save this money differ, and our discernment team will host an informational meeting for the congregation this week. While exploring various possibilities and allowing members to share their views is important, it is crucial that we focus on sharing the story of the team's efforts and insights. Stories hold power, and recounting how God has worked in our conversations, meetings, and discussions can unite and transform opinions. Ultimately, the question should not be *What do I think we should do?*, but rather *What does God want us to do?* To achieve this, we need to emphasize storytelling and communicate effectively about it. As Housel might say, *this has always been the case and always will be*.

The book offers various insights and applications for those in church ministry. Here are a few to consider, making it a valuable addition to your reading list for 2025:

1. **The Predictability of Human Behavior**: Human behavior tends to be predictable due to core emotions like fear and greed that are consistent across generations, helping navigate congregational dynamics.
  
2. **The Long Game in Leadership**: Success usually stems from long-term efforts rather than immediate gains, highlighting the value of patience in ministry.

3. **The Role of Uncertainty and Ambiguity**: Resilience and adaptability are essential in facing an uncertain future, encouraging faith over fear of the unknown.

4. **Avoiding Short-Term Thinking**: Short-term decisions can undermine long-term health, prompting a focus on sustainable growth rather than immediate results.

5. **The Power of Perspective**: Small shifts in perspective can transform how challenges are viewed, helping congregants see trials as growth opportunities.

6. **Resilience Through Consistency**: While the world changes, constants like hard work and humility remain essential, reinforcing the importance of spiritual disciplines.

7. **The Seduction of Extremes**: Balancing extremes leads to better outcomes, encouraging thoughtful decision-making and conflict resolution.

8. **Trust as the Ultimate Currency**: Trust is vital in healthy relationships, necessitating transparency and integrity in leadership.

9. **Wealth vs. Richness**: True wealth is about time and freedom, prompting a focus on eternal priorities over material accumulation.

10. **The Compounding Power of Small Actions**: Consistent small actions yield significant results over time, emphasizing everyday faithfulness.
