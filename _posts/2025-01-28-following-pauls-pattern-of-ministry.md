I love the book of Acts because Luke guides us through the history of the early church, allowing us to grasp how early Christians followed God's guidance. By reflecting on their actions, we gain insight into what it means to live according to God's will each day.

In Acts 17, Paul and his companions arrive in Thessalonica, where, as noted in verses 1-2, Paul regularly ministers in the synagogue:

> (Acts 17:1–2 NIV) When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures.

The phrase *as was his custom* highlights that Paul frequently engaged in this type of ministry, utilizing the synagogue as a venue to share about Jesus with those seeking God—a practice reminiscent of Jesus, who also frequented the synagogue:

> (Luke 4:16 NIV) He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom...

For Paul, the synagogue is a vital setting for sharing Jesus' message. Similarly, as pastors, the church serves as an essential place for us to share, reason, build relationships, and fulfill our God-given ministry.

However, Paul's ministry extends beyond the synagogue. In verse 17, we see:

> (Acts 17:17 NIV11-GK) So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.

He also engages with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers and speaks at the Areopagus, demonstrating the importance of being present in public spaces.

Paul's daily routines remind us that our work should be a balance between sacred and secular settings. As pastors, we may find ourselves primarily in church, interacting mainly with church members since our salary originates there; this can lead to misunderstandings about our work ethic when we are not in the office. But what if we envisioned our ministry as encompassing both the church and the outside world? What if we recognized our interactions with non-religious people as equally significant as those within the church?

As we reflect on work-life balance, we should also consider balance in our ministry contexts. This means allocating our time and energy between sacred and secular spaces, or perhaps considering all spaces as sacred. For instance, the gym could serve as an intentional environment to connect with others for the sake of Jesus, while activities like joining a mountain bike group or having dinner with neighbors might also be viewed as part of our ministry. Jesus and Paul both understood the value of engaging in both the synagogue and the marketplace. How well are we balancing our lives to be present in both arenas?
