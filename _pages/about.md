Rev. Dr. Wade S. Allen has devoted over three decades to ministry, bringing deep experience and a passion for spiritual leadership to every congregation he serves. Raised in Georgia, Wade was nurtured in the Christian faith from a young age and was baptized at seven. His involvement in a strong youth ministry during his formative years laid the groundwork for his calling to vocational ministry.

Following high school, Wade pursued a degree in Biblical Studies at Liberty University. Despite experiencing the profound loss of his father during his freshman year, Wade’s commitment to ministry grew stronger. This challenging time spurred him into his first role as a youth ministry intern, igniting a passion for student ministry that would shape the next fifteen years of his life.

In 2008, sensing a new direction from God, Wade transitioned into pastoral ministry, a call that was affirmed when he became the pastor of First Baptist Church in Muncie, Indiana. His pastoral approach is grounded in scriptural authority, spiritual leadership, and collaboration with the laity to nurture the church community.

Wade earned his Doctor of Ministry from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, where his dissertation focused on leading churches through conflict by developing a process of spiritual discernment. He also holds a Master of Divinity from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, with an emphasis on Christian Education and Leadership, and a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies from Liberty University.

Throughout his ministry, Wade has held various leadership roles within the American Baptist Churches of Indiana and Kentucky, including serving as President from 2016 to 2018. His commitment to fostering strong relationships across denominational lines underscores his dedication to a broad Christian witness.

Beyond his pastoral duties, Wade enjoys teaching, mentoring, and guiding others on their spiritual journeys, always seeking to follow God’s direction and leadership in all aspects of his work.
