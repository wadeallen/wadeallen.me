Raised in Georgia, Wade developed deep roots in the Christian faith from an early age, being baptized at seven and actively participating in youth ministry during his formative years—experiences that would later shape his calling to vocational ministry.

While pursuing Biblical Studies at Liberty University, Wade faced a pivotal moment with the loss of his father during his freshman year. This challenging season strengthened his commitment to ministry and led him to his first youth ministry internship, launching a fifteen-year journey in student ministry.

In 2008, following God's leading, Wade transitioned to pastoral ministry and became the pastor of First Baptist Church in Muncie, Indiana. His leadership philosophy centers on biblical teaching, spiritual guidance, and active partnership with the congregation to nurture spiritual growth.

Wade's academic journey includes a Doctor of Ministry from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he specialized in church conflict resolution through spiritual discernment. He also holds a Master of Divinity from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, focusing on Christian Education and Leadership, complementing his Bachelor's in Biblical Studies from Liberty University.

His broader denominational service includes leadership roles within the American Baptist Churches of Indiana and Kentucky, notably serving as President from 2016 to 2018. Wade's ministry emphasizes building bridges across denominational and theological boundaries to strengthen the wider Christian community.

Wade and his wife Christy have shared life's journey since 1994 and are the proud parents of three grown children.

When he's not serving his congregation or mentoring others in their spiritual journey, Wade can be found mountain biking, trail running, or cheering on his beloved Georgia Bulldogs—he's an avid coffee enthusiast, technology buff, and lifelong learner who finds joy in both athletic pursuits and quiet moments with a good book.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
